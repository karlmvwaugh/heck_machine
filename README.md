# heck_machine
Collaborative Synth Website



Made using i_dropped_my_phone_the_screen_cracked, d3 and socket.io, The Heck Machine is a simple noise synth website with the aim of being fun and easy to play with. 
Any changes to settings are communicated to anyone also on the page so that it acts as one instance of a synth that everyone is playing. 
There are two oscillators run through a short series of effects, a cross fader between these, a touch pad synth, and some basic chat functionality.
