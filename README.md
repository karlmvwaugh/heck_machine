Collaborative Synth Website 
The Heck Machine is a simple noise synth website with the aim of being fun and easy to play with. Any changes to settings are communicated to anyone also on the page so that it acts as one instance of a synth that everyone is playing.

Made using i_dropped_my_phone_the_screen_cracked, d3 and socket.io. 
 
There are two oscillators run through a short series of effects, a cross fader between these, a touch pad synth, some basic chat functionality, a mute button and a user count.
 The only values not shared across all instances are mute button, the colours that appear from the touch pad apon touch (your own circles are red to you. but green to everyone else), and some aspects of the chat server (you might be typing on different parts of the "canvas", although this could be fixed I don't mind it. The colours on the letters are universal, so I dunno why not the text position. Hey ho).
